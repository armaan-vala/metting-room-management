# metting-room-management

During my internship, I noticed my team was wasting a lot of energy just trying to book meeting rooms. We were constantly clashing with other teams and spending too much time coordinating instead of working. To fix this, I built a straightforward scheduling tool to manage the bookings. It worked perfectly and taught me a valuable lesson: sometimes, simple problems just need simple solutions.
